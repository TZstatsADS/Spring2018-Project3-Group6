+ Project summary: 

In this project, we created a classification engine for images of dogs versus fried chicken versus blueberry muffins. We tried classifiers (GBM, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGboost and Neural Networks) under different feature extraction(Sift, HoG, RGB, surf). By comparing the accurancy rate as well as the processing time, we finally chose the best classification method.
	
**Contribution statement**: 

Project 3
Contribution Statement: 

1. Mengqi Chen (mc4396): Extracted RGB feature and built relevant models, tested all models and organized files
2. Shan He (sh3667): Extracted Hog feature and built hog-feature, lbp-feature models, delivered presentation
3. Yuhao Kang (yk2758): Built baseline models
4. Michael Utomo (mu2251): XGBoost, and neural network algorithms
5. Linna Lu (ly2424): Extracted surf feature and built relevant models

Summary:

In this project, we developed a new method and improved the classification accuracy for images of blueberry muffins, fried chickens and dogs to over 90%.
